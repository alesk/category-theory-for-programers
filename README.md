# Category Theory for Programmers

This repository consists of my personal assignments and solutions from the book "Category Theory for Programmers" by Bartosz Milewski. The repository features implementations in four programming languages: Haskell, Scala, C++, and Python. The goal of this project is to provide practical examples of the application of category theory concepts in different programming languages.

## Contents
This repository consists of:
* Solutions to exercises in Haskell, Scala, C++, and Python
* Some additional sample codes to illustrate concepts
* Links to helpful resources and references

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have the following software installed:

* [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (for Haskell code)
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) (for Scala code)
* A C++ compiler like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) (for C++ code)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for Python code)

#### Running Haskell Code
```bash
ghc your_file.hs -o your_program
./your_program
```
Replace "your_file.hs" with the name of the file you wish to compile, and "your_program" with the name of the output program.

#### Running Scala Code
```bash
sbt run
```
Note: This command should be run in the directory containing the `build.sbt` file.

#### Running C++ Code
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o your_program your_file.cpp
./your_program
```
Replace "your_file.cpp" with the name of the file you wish to compile, and "your_program" with the name of the output program.

#### Running Python Code
```bash
python your_file.py
```
Replace "your_file.py" with the name of the Python script you wish to run.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate and adhere to the code style conventions of each language.
