Yes, when a function returns a `Box` object, it's generally a good idea to specify the type of the object contained in the `Box` in the function's return type hint. This makes the function's type signature more descriptive and helps to prevent type-related errors.

Here's an example:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")

class Box(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, value: T):
        self.value = value

    def get(self) -> T:
        return self.value

def make_int_box(n: int) -> Box[int]:
    return Box(n)
```

In this example, the `make_int_box` function returns a `Box[int]`. This makes it clear that the function will return a `Box` containing an `int`.

On the other hand, if you use just `Box` as the return type, it wouldn't be clear what type of object is inside the `Box`. This could lead to confusion and errors. Hence, using `Box[int]` or any other specific type in the `Box` is generally a good practice for better type safety and code readability.

It's worth noting that Python's type hints are optional and don't affect the runtime behavior of the code. They're mainly used for static type checking, autocompletion, and documentation.
